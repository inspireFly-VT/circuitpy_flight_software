# Define pins connected to the chip, use these if wiring up the breakout according to the guide:
CS = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.SPI0_CS0)
RESET = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.RF1_RST)

# uncommnet the desired import and rfm initialization depending on the radio boards being used

# Use rfm9x for two RFM9x radios using LoRa
